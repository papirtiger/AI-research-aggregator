# AI Research Updates Script

This script aggregates and processes recent AI research updates from arXiv, focusing primarily on papers in the Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Computer Science - Computation and Language (cs.CL) categories.

## Features

- Fetches recent paper information from arXiv RSS feeds
- Processes and formats paper details including title, abstract, and link
- Categorizes papers by announcement type (new, cross-list, replace, etc.)
- Provides a timestamp for when the updates were fetched

## Output Format

The script generates a structured output containing:

1. A timestamp of when the updates were fetched
2. A list of papers from the cs.AI feed, including:
   - Headline (paper title)
   - Description (includes arXiv ID, announcement type, and abstract)
   - Link to the full paper on arXiv
3. A list of papers from the cs.CL feed, following the same format

## Usage

To use this script:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (likely an RSS feed parser and HTTP client)
2. Run the script to fetch the latest updates
3. The output will be generated in a text format, which can be saved to a file or further processed as needed

## Note

This script is designed to provide a quick overview of recent AI research papers. It's particularly useful for researchers, students, or professionals who want to stay updated on the latest developments in AI and computational linguistics.

Remember to respect arXiv's terms of service and avoid making too frequent requests to their RSS feeds.

## Future Improvements

- Add command-line arguments for customizing the output format or selecting specific categories
- Implement filtering options to focus on specific topics or keywords
- Add functionality to export the results in different formats (e.g., JSON, CSV)
- Integrate with a database to track papers over time
